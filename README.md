# Binarization Segformer

A semantic segmentation model for pixel-wise document image binarization.

## Overview

Segformer is an efficient semantic segmentation model introduced by [Xie et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.15203) in 2021.

In this repository, we will provide a fine-tuning of Segformer for pixel-wise document image binarization.

## Dataset

The dataset is an ensemble of 14 datasets replicating the setting used in SauvolaNet by [Li et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05521) in 2021.
